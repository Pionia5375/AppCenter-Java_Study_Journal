# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal study journal for AppCenter Java/Spring Boot learning. It contains no build system, tests, or runnable application — only study notes and coding practice files.

## Structure

- `spring/` — Daily study notes as Markdown files, named `YYYY_MM_DD.md`. Topics progress from Java basics (variables, types, methods) through Spring Boot, JPA, and Spring Security.
- `coding_test/` — Java coding test/algorithm practice files.

## Conventions

- File naming: date-based format `YYYY_MM_DD.md` for study notes
- Commit messages: Korean, prefixed with date (e.g., `20260215 공부기록 저장`)
- Study notes are written in Korean and include inline Java/Spring code examples
- Notes often contain ASCII tables and structured concept summaries
